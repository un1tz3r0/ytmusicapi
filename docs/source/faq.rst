Usage
-----------------------

How do I add a song, album, artist or playlist to my library?
***********************************************************************
- **songs**: `edit_song_library_status <Reference.html#ytmusicapi.YTMusic.edit_song_library_status>`__ .
  Liking a song using `rate_song <Reference.html#ytmusicapi.YTMusic.rate_song>`__
  does *not* add it to your library, only to your liked songs playlist.
- **albums, playlists**: `rate_playlist <Reference.html#ytmusicapi.YTMusic.rate_playlist>`__
- **artists**: `subscribe_artists <Reference.html#ytmusicapi.YTMusic.subscribe_artists>`__ .
  This will add the artist to your Subscriptions tab. The Artists tab is determined by the songs/albums you have
  added to your library.



How can I get the radio playlist for a song, video, playlist or album?
***********************************************************************
- **songs, videos**: ``RDAMVM`` + ``videoId``
- **playlists, albums**: ``RDAMPL`` + ``playlistId``


How can I get the shuffle playlist for a playlist or album?
***********************************************************************
Use `get_watch_playlist_shuffle <Reference.html#ytmusicapi.YTMusic.get_watch_playlist_shuffle>`__
with the ``playlistId`` or ``audioPlaylistId`` (albums).

How can I get all my public playlists in a single request?
***********************************************************************
Call `get_user_playlists <Reference.html#ytmusicapi.YTMusic.get_user_playlists>`__
with your own ``channelId``.

Can I download songs?

YouTube Music API Internals
------------------------------

Is there a difference between songs and videos?
***********************************************************************
Yes. Videos are regular videos from YouTube, which can be uploaded by any user. Songs are actual songs uploaded by artists.

You can also add songs to your library, while you can't add videos.

Is there a rate limit?
***********************************************************************
There most certainly is, although you shouldn't run into it during normal usage.

What is a browseId?
***********************************************************************
A ``browseId`` is an internal, globally unique identifier used by YouTube Music for browsable content.
